# 100-Days-of-Python

A new journey has begun. Coming from a beginner stand point as a Python developer. I've decided to challenge myself each day for an hour to code anything in python. It can be anything I want, as long as I take an hour a day to do it. Putting this in a habit will allow me to increasingly develop my skill in Python. Doing is the best method to learn!
